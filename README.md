Dharmafly Docs
==============

What is Dharmafly Docs for?
-----------------------------

Dharmafly Docs should be used to create github pages (websites) for any Dharmafly project

How Can I update or add posts on any Dharmafly project website?
--------------------------------------------------------

See the other branch, [gh-pages] (https://github.com/dharmafly/dharmafly-docs/tree/gh-pages) for an overview of adding posts, code snippets and any other items on any Dharmafly project website?

How Can I set up a new Dharmafly project website?
----------------------------

See the [documentation on the gh-pages branch] (https://github.com/dharmafly/dharmafly-docs/tree/gh-pages#how-can-i-set-up-a-new-dharmafly-project-website)

What does this project ([dharmafly-docs] (https://github.com/dharmafly/dharmafly-docs)) contain?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project comprises two branches: *master* and *gh-pages*.

This branch (master) contains only this README, which gives instructions on updating and managing dharmafly docs in general.

The other branch, [gh-pages] (https://github.com/dharmafly/dharmafly-docs/tree/gh-pages) shows you how to update existing Dharmafly project websites and set up project websites for any Dharmafly projects.

It contains a Dharmafly project website template (which also acts as a styleguide) showing all modules you can use in your project site.

How Can I update the styling or format of all Dharmafly project websites?
------------------------------

Changes made to this repository won't automatically be reflected in projects previously created using the code in this repository and the github pages facility.

An [issue exists] (https://github.com/dharmafly/dharmafly-docs/issues/8) for this enhancement.

How Can I add a new page (not a new post) to a Dharmafly project
-----------------------------------------------

There's no process yet to do this easily, but [this issue outlines the process required to generalise adding new page levels]
(https://github.com/dharmafly/dharmafly-docs/issues/1)

Is there a process for automatically generating new project websites from project documentation?
----------------------------

There is no process as yet, the process for doing this would be along the lines of the [build script for lanyrd.js] (https://github.com/dharmafly/lanyrd.js/blob/gh-pages/_bin/build), as outlined in [this issue] (https://github.com/dharmafly/dharmafly-docs/issues/2)

How do I add a new icon for the coding language my project's about? 
-------------------------------------------------

If the language exists as an icon, please see the [documentation on the gh-pages branch] (https://github.com/dharmafly/dharmafly-docs/tree/gh-pages#changing-the-language-icon). If not, you can [create a new icon to be available to all projects using dharmafly-docs] (https://github.com/dharmafly/dharmafly-docs/wiki/Adding-a-new-language-icon-to-the-sidebar)
